Visual and Intelligent Data Analytics Lab (VIDA) Lab at [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), Singapore, is dedicated to advancing the frontiers of visual analytics, data visualization, and human-centered AI.
Situated within the [College of Computing and Data Science (CCDS)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/computing), VIDA Lab focuses on designing intelligent, interactive systems that empower users to make sense of complex data through visual and explainable means.

VIDA lab is led by [Dr. Yong Wang](https://yong-wang.org/), a tenure-track Assistant Professor at CCDS, NTU. Prior to joining NTU, Dr. Yong Wang was an Assistant Professor at the [School of Computing and Information Systems (SCIS)](https://computing.smu.edu.sg/), [Singapore Management University (SMU)](https://smu.edu.sg) and received his PhD from the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](http://www.ust.hk/) under the supervision of [Prof. Huamin Qu](http://huamin.org/).

### Research Areas
Our research intersects multiple disciplines, including:

- **Information Visualization:** Novel techniques for visual encoding and layout of complex data.
- **Interactive Visual Analytics:** Human-in-the-loop systems that support sense-making, reasoning, and decision-making.
- **Human-Computer Interaction:** Designing interfaces that are intuitive, responsive, and adaptive to user needs.
- **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI):** Visual and interaction-driven approaches to interpret AI models and predictions.

We actively apply our research across domains such as online learning, FinTech, quantum computing, and smart manufacturing, with coverage by international media such as NHK, IEEE Spectrum, and the ACM SIGGRAPH Blog.

### Join Us
We are currently recruiting Ph.D./M.Eng. students, Research Assistants (RAs), and Visiting Interns who are passionate about visualization, AI, and human-computer interaction.
Feel free to reach out via email if you're interested!
